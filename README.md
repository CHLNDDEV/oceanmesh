# pyOceanMesh

Automatic coastal ocean mesh generation from ESRI Shapefiles and digitial elevation models. 

A direct port of the original MATLAB implementation of OceanMesh2D into pure Python. This represents a fully open-source effort to expose the functionality and capability presented in the original package to a much wider-user base.
